Orange LED
==========

The Orange LED on the Sensorian board can be used in Python by
manipulating its GPIO pin. The following example shows how to blink the
LED in Python. ::

	import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
	import time

	P0 = 12 # LED pin

	"""Setups the pins in BCM mode
	:param none: 
	:returns none : 
	"""
	def Init():
		GPIO.setwarnings(False) # suppress GPIO used message
		GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD) # use BCM pin numbers
		GPIO.setup(P0, GPIO.OUT) # set LED pin as output

	"""Turns on the LED on port P0
	:param none: 
	:returns none : 
	"""
	def LEDon():
		GPIO.output(P0, GPIO.HIGH)

	"""Turns off the LED on port P0
	:param none: 
	:returns none : 
	"""
	def LEDoff():
		GPIO.output(P0, GPIO.LOW)

	"""Sets the LED state as HIGH or LOW
	:param state: state of the LED, can be 1 for HIGH or 0 for LOW.
	:returns none : 
	"""
	def SetLED(state):
		if state:
			LEDon()
		else:
			LEDoff()


	# if not used as a module (standalone), run this test program 
	if __name__ == "__main__":
		Init()
		try:
			while(True):
				LEDoff()
				time.sleep(0.5)
				LEDon()
				time.sleep(0.5)
				
		except KeyboardInterrupt:
			print("Clean exit on CTRL-C")
			GPIO.cleanup()
